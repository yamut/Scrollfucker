# Scrollfucker
Inspired by fuck overlays, tries to recover the scrollbar on sites where the overlay has fucked you over.

Google doesn't allow extensions or some shit outside of chrome OS anymore so if you want this you can download the release and load it in chrome via the extensions tab.

Menu->Settings->Extensions

Then click the developer mode checkbox

Click the 'load unpacked extension button' and select the directory you extracted the files to, and good to go. 

I recommend using this with f*ck overlays.
