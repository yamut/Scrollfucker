# Scrollfucker
Inspired by fuck overlays, tries to recover the scrollbar on sites where the overlay has fucked you over.

You can load this without going through the appstore if that's something you're into, follow the steps below:

1. Menu->Settings->Extensions
2. Then click the developer mode checkbox
3. Click the 'load unpacked extension button' and select the directory you extracted the files to, and good to go. 

I recommend using this with f*ck overlays.
